## Random Quote Machine -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
2. I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

I first completed this task using JQuery, Ajax and it worked functionally but I didn't understand the code at all. After relooking at the code I decided to redo it all using native JavaScript and the Fetch API. I'm glad I went to the effort of recoding this project since I learnt a lot and reinforced my comprehension of things I thought I understood.
