[x] I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

I first completed this task using JQuery, Ajax and it worked functionally but I didn't understand the code at all. After relooking at the code I decided to redo it all using native JavaScript and the Fetch API. I'm glad I went to the effort of recoding this project since I learnt a lot and reinforced my comprehension of things I thought I understood.

I also have got rid of the Bootstrap code I was using and replaced it with native CSS and Flexbox, as well as making the project mobile responsive.
