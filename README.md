## Random Quote Machine -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
- [x] I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
- [x] I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

This is my 3rd project for the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. The most recent version of this project was written in React using Create-React-App. In the past, I have made versions of this project in Bootstrap and then pure HTML and CSS, using Flexbox.

**Improvements:**
- Fix the ::backdrop CSS element on the Dialog element. It works in the vanilla JS version but not in the React version.

**Getting Started:**
 1. Run: `npm install`
 2. Run: `npm start` _(in a new terminal)_
 3. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/`

You can see a Vanilla JS demo of this [Random Quote Machine](https://codepen.io/Pagey/pen/eEXRZy) project on CodePen.
