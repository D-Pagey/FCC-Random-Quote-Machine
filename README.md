## Random Quote Machine -  A Free Code Camp project

**User Stories:**
1. I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
2. I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

I hacked my way through this project without fully understanding it. I think I'm going to redo the JQuery using native JavaScript as I understand it better having completed the Local Weather App project.
